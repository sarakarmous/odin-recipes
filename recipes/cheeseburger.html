    <h2> delicious onion cheeseburger made </h2>
    <p> I make these burgers with caramelized onions and sharp 
        Cheddar cheese. I serve them on brioche buns and eat 
        them plain. Hubby likes to add lettuce, pickles, tomatoes,
         and more fresh onions! With or without all of the topping,
          they are delicious.  </p>
          <h3> Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>
              <li> 1 pound ground beef (80 percent lean) </li>
              <li> 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce </li>
              <li> salt and ground black pepper to taste </li>
              <li> 2 tablespoons salted butter </v>
              <li> 1 large onion, thinly sliced  </li>
              <li> 3 slices sharp Cheddar cheese </li>
              <li> 3 rolls brioche, split and toasted </li>


          </ul>



          <ol>
            <li> Place ground beef in a bowl and season with Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper. Mix thoroughly and shape into 3 balls. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a large skillet. Add onion and cook until onions start to brown, 
                5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the skillet. Add 3 ground 
                beef balls to the same skillet and flatten with a cast iron 
                press or a heavy spatula. Evenly top each patty with onions 
                and cook for 3 to 4 minutes more. </li>

            <li> Carefully flip patties over so that the onions
                 are now on the bottom, pressing once again with cast
                  iron press or heavy spatula. Top each with a slice of
                   cheese and cook until cheese is melted and burgers have
                    reached the desired doneness, 3 to 4 minutes. Serve on
                     brioche buns.</li>
        </ol>
