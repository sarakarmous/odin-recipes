    <p> Onion burgers are one of America's greatest regional renditions, but be warned--these are diner style,
         and prepare for those drops of grease, but don't let it scare
          you. They're so craveable, you may want to eat a second! 
          You do not want to use anything under an 80/20 fat ratio.
           If you do, they won't be good. </p>
