    <h1> Sarah's Oklahoma Onion Burger</h1>
    <img src="https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.media-allrecipes.com%2Fuserphotos%2F8895301.jpg&w=596&h=596&c=sc&poi=face&q=60">
    <p> Onion burgers are one of America's greatest regional renditions, but be warned--these are diner style,
         and prepare for those drops of grease, but don't let it scare
          you. They're so craveable, you may want to eat a second! 
          You do not want to use anything under an 80/20 fat ratio.
           If you do, they won't be good. </p>
    <h1> Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <il>2 tablespoons salted butter </il> 
        <il>1 tablespoon olive oil </il>
        <il>1 large onion, very thinly sliced </il>
        <il>½ teaspoon granulated garlic </il>
        <il>1 pound 85% lean ground beef </il>
        <il>1 teaspoon Hamburger Seasoning </il>
        <il>½ cup sliced portobello mushrooms </il>
        <il>ground black pepper to taste </il>
        <il>4 slices Swiss cheese </il>
        <il>4 rolls rolls, hamburger, white, enriched, plain </il>


    </ul>

    <ol>
        <il>Heat a skillet over medium heat. Add butter and oil; 
            heat until butter is melted. Add onion and garlic. 
            Cook until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</il>
        <il>Meanwhile, divide ground meat into 4 portions and shape into patties.
             Season with salt and seasoning.</il>
        <il>Heat a large skillet or flat-top over medium-high heat for a few minutes. 
            Place patties into the hot skillet and smash with a 
            spatula or bacon press. Hold patties down for 30 seconds,
             then cover each patty with some of the cooked onion. 
             Cook for 2 minutes. Carefully flip burgers, making sure 
             to scrape the browned bits off the skillet.</il>
        <il>Press down on the flipped patties to sink 
            the onions into the meat.</il>
        <il>Meanwhile, add sliced mushrooms to the skillet used
             for the onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.</il>
        <il>Season patties with salt and pepper and place a slice of cheese on each. 
            Cook until burgers have reached the desired doneness,
             2 to 4 minutes more. Top each patty with leftover onion
              and mushrooms and serve on buns.</il>
